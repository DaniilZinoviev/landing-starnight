# Landing Page "Starnight"

PSD template was found in the Internet and I've created this beatiful and simple site.

Technologies I used:
 - HTML
 - SCSS (via Gulp)

Features and libraries:
 - Hero video
 - A couple of sliders

## How to launch?

1) Donwload archive or clone repository
2) Run ```npm i``` and ```bower install``` to install necessary packages
3) Run ```gulp```
It will open a browser window on localhost:3000/ with this site
